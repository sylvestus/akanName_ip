            <h3>More About Akan Names</h3>
            <p>
                Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and
                <br>
                Ghana. A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of
                their<br>
                birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they get irrespective of their
                gender.<br>
                These Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan tradition, each child is born with a
                name<br>
                associated to their soul. The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul. The well
                thought<br>
                and organized naming system of the Akan’s was initiated by the ancestors and has attracted so many
                people’s<br>
                attention as they desire to know more about these names. As a matter of fact, it is possible to tell
                what<br>
                led to someone’s birth, the day they were born and their rank among the siblings just by their names.
